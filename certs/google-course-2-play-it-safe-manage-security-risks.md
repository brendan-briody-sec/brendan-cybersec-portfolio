- **Security frameworks:** Explored the **CIA Triad**, **NIST RMF**, **NIST CSF**, and **OWASP** principles — and how organisations use these frameworks to standardise and strengthen security operations.

### Reflection
Course 2 gave me a clearer understanding of how organisations apply frameworks, controls, and structured processes to manage risk. It also introduced the practical workflow that analysts follow during incidents — including how playbooks guide consistent and effective responses.
