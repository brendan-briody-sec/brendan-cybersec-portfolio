# Botium Toys Security Audit — Risk Review & Recommendations

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.  
The objective was to review Botium Toys current security posture, identify risks, and recommend improvements based on industry best practices.

## 🎯 Scope  
The audit reviewed:
- Internal systems & employee devices  
- Internal network & internet access  
- Data storage & handling practices  
- Security tools, controls, and policies  
- Compliance considerations (PCI DSS, data privacy)  
- Business continuity readiness  

## 🛑 Key Risks Identified  

| Category | Issue | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|
| Asset Management | No full asset inventory or classification | High |
| Access Control | Excessive permissions, no least-privilege | High |
| Data Security | No encryption for payment & customer data | High |
| Password Security | Weak policy, no centralized management | Medium–High |
| Threat Detection | No IDS deployed | Medium–High |
| Continuity | No backup or disaster recovery plan | High |
| Legacy Systems | No scheduled maintenance plan | Medium |

## ✅ Recommendations  
Based on the risks identified, I recommend Botium Toys implement the following security improvements to strengthen its security posture:

- **Develop a complete asset inventory and classification system** to ensure all devices, systems, and data are tracked and protected properly.
- **Introduce least-privilege access controls** so employees only access the information needed for their roles, reducing the chance of accidental or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Enable encryption for customer and payment information**, both in transit and at rest, to protect confidentiality and support regulatory compliance.
- **Strengthen password requirements and implement a centralized password management solution** to improve authentication security and reduce password-related risks.
- **Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to help identify unusual or malicious activity as early as possible.
- **Create regular data backup procedures and a disaster recovery plan** so critical information can be restored and business operations can continue after an incident.
- **Schedule consistent maintenance for legacy systems** to prevent security issues resulting from outdated technology.

These changes will help protect customer data, support compliance requirements, and reduce the company’s overall security risk.

## 🚀 Personal Reflection
For this project, I focused on applying foundational security principles and best practices. This project strengthened my understanding of risk management, security controls, and how to communicate findings clearly and professionally. 
This project allowed me to activity demonstrates my ability to select controls that Botium Toys does or does not need to implement and compliance best practices that the company needs to adhere to in order to mitigate risks and avoid fines.
