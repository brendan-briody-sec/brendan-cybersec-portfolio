## Cybersecurity Fundamentals
- **Core Principles:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)
- **Security Models & Controls:** Security controls (administrative / technical / physical), least privilege, defense-in-depth
- **Security Concepts:** Threat vs vulnerability vs risk, authentication vs authorization, security policies & standards
  - **Evidence:** Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Course 1
  - **Applied:** Interpreted core security principles and mapped them to real-world security controls
  - **Proof:** Google Cybersecurity course notes & module completion

## Networking
- **TCP/IP, OSI, DNS, DHCP, VPNs, Firewalls**
  - **Evidence:** TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals
  - **Applied:** Traced DNS → IP; mapped OSI layers to packet captures
- **Subnetting & CIDR**
  - **Evidence:** TryHackMe labs + personal notes
  - **Applied:** Designed `/28` lab network → IP plan for hosts/gateway/broadcast

## Linux / Command Line
- **Filesystem navigation, permissions, processes, monitoring** *(in progress)*
  - **Evidence:** Basics done on Google Cybersecurity Course 1 + (coming from Linux Fundamentals rooms)
  - **Planned Proof:** cheatsheet + task screenshots

## Security Tools
- **Wireshark (basics)** – filter, follow streams, export objects
  - **Evidence:** THM packet analysis modules
- **Nmap (basics)** – host discovery, service/version detection
  - **Evidence:** THM rooms; notes on `-sV -sC -Pn`
- **Vulnerability Scanning (concepts)** – scan → verify → report
  - **Evidence:** Google course + THM

## Threats & Attacks
- **Phishing, Social Engineering, BEC, Malware Types**
  - **Evidence:** Google Course 1 + THM Intro to Cybersecurity
  - **Applied:** Drafted simulated BEC scenario + response steps

## Security Documentation
- **Audit Checklists, Risk Analysis, Scope Docs, Findings Reports**
  - **Evidence:** Botium Toys audit deliverables
  - **Proof:** `cyber-projects/google-cyber-cert/botium-toys-audit`

## Version Control / Git
- **Commits, branches, repo structure, clean READMEs**
  - **Evidence:** Portfolio build + refactors
  - **Applied:** Standardised `projects/`, `skills/`, `screenshots/` structure

## Soft Skills
- **Documentation, Problem Solving, Attention to Detail, Learning Discipline**
  - **Evidence:** Public LinkedIn progress posts; consistent repo updates, certs achieved

## Roadmap

**In Progress:** TryHackMe Network Fundamentals - Currently learning the core concepts of how computers communicate with each other and types of network weaknesses.

**Next:** How The Web Works - This section teaches how to become a better hacker as it's vital to understand the underlying functions of the world wide web and what makes it work.

**Later:** Linux Fundamentals - Many servers and security tools use Linux. Here I'll learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cyber security.
