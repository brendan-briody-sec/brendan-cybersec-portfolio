### Objective
Build a strong foundational understanding of how computer networks work, why they matter in cybersecurity, and how attackers and defenders use this knowledge to scan, secure, and monitor systems.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Core networking concepts:** Learned how data moves across networks, the roles of switches, routers, firewalls, and how topologies (star, mesh, bus) impact reliability and security.  
- **OSI vs TCP/IP models:** Gained a clear understanding of the layers, what each one is responsible for, and how issues are diagnosed (Packets? Routing? Encryption?).  
- **IP addressing & subnetting:** Practiced breaking networks into subnets, understanding CIDR notation, and identifying usable host ranges — essential for scanning and isolating lab environments.  
- **Ports & protocols:** Covered the most common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, RDP, SMB) and how protocols operate behind the scenes.  
- **DNS & HTTP(S):** Learned how domain resolution works and how web traffic is structured, which is crucial for threat analysis, web exploitation, and log interpretation.  
- **Practical cyber relevance:** Understood how attackers enumerate networks (port scans, service discovery) and how defenders detect suspicious connections, misconfigurations, or failed authentication attempts.

### Reflection
This section was extremely important for my progress. Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity, and concepts like ports, IP addresses, TCP handshakes, and packet flow directly connect to the hands-on labs I’m building in VirtualBox (Nmap scans, SSH testing, packet captures, log correlation).  
I now feel more confident reading network diagrams, understanding scan results, and building isolated home labs for safe testing.

### Next Step
I’m close to completing **Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Course 2 (Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks)**, and I’ve now begun **TryHackMe Pre-Security Part 3 — How the Web Works**.
