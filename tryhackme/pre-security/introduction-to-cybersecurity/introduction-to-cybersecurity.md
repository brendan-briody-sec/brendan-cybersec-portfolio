### Objective
Explore both offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity, understand how ethical hackers test systems safely, and learn the main defensive roles that protect organizations from threats.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Offensive security:** Learned how ethical hackers operate within legal boundaries to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.  
- **Defensive security:** Gained a high-level overview of **SOC operations, threat intelligence, digital forensics (DFIR), malware analysis, and SIEM tools** — the core pillars of blue-team work.  
- **Career insight:** Understood the major career paths in cybersecurity (SOC analyst, penetration tester, incident responder, threat intel analyst) and what skills each one focuses on.  
- **Practical perspective:** Experienced how an ethical hacker might “hack” a safe website and why the same mindset is used to secure real systems.

### Reflection
This section helped me to understand the difference between offensive (ethical hacking) and defensive (security operations, threat detection) cybersecurity. I now have a much clearer picture of the different paths in this field, and I’m still exploring which direction I’ll specialize in as I gain more hands-on experience.
