# TryHackMe — Pre-Security Path (Part 2: Network Fundamentals)

**Status:** Completed  
**Date Completed:** *13/11/2025*  
**Modules Covered:**  
- What is Networking?  
- Intro to LAN  
- OSI Model  
- Packets & Frames  
- Extending Your Network  

---

### Objective
Build a solid understanding of computer networking, from how devices communicate on a local network to how data travels across the internet. Learned the foundational concepts needed for cybersecurity work, including protocols, addressing, topologies, and packet structure.

---

### Key Takeaways

#### **Module 1 — What is Networking?**
- Understood how devices communicate and what makes a “network.”  
- Learned the difference between the internet and local networks.  
- Identified common network devices and how ICMP (Ping) is used to test connectivity.

#### **Module 2 — Intro to LAN**
- Explored LAN topologies (bus, star, mesh) and why modern networks prefer switched star designs.  
- Learned the basics of **subnetting**, why subnets exist, and how they structure networks.  
- Understood ARP (maps IP → MAC) and DHCP (assigns IPs automatically).

#### **Module 3 — OSI Model**
- Broke down the **7-layer OSI Model**, learning the role of each layer.  
- Learned how data flows through Physical → Application layers.  
- Practiced identifying which technologies/protocols belong to which layer.

#### **Module 4 — Packets & Frames**
- Understood how data is encapsulated as it moves through a network.  
- Explored TCP/IP, including the **Three-Way Handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)**.  
- Learned the differences between **TCP (reliable)** and **UDP (fast, connectionless)**.  
- Completed practical labs on ports and handshake analysis.

#### **Module 5 — Extending Your Network**
- Learned how **port forwarding** exposes internal services externally.  
- Gained foundational knowledge of **firewalls**, basic rules, and packet filtering.  
- Understood **VPN basics** and encryption tunnels.  
- Explored LAN networking devices (modems, switches, routers) and used a network simulator to design small networks.

### Reflection
This module gave me a strong foundation in networking — one of the most important skills in cybersecurity. I now understand how networks are structured, how data moves through them, and how protocols and devices interact. This knowledge directly supports my hands-on labs and will be essential when I move into threat detection, packet analysis, and more advanced security topics.
